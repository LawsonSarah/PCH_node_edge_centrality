CODE:
----------------------------------------
Code contained in this repo accompanies the paper "An application of node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality to a protein complex hypernetwork." Lawson, S., Donovan, D., Lefevre, J. School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Queensland 2024. Please quote this paper if using the code.

This code incorporates code from the paper "Node and edge nonlinear eigenvector centrality for hypergraphs" Tudisco F, Higham DJ. Node and edge nonlinear eigenvector centrality for hypergraphs. Communications Physics. 2021 Jan;4:244. https://github.com/ftudisco/node-edge-hypergraph-centrality including but not limited to the make_mappings, read_data and compute_centrality functions. Please refer to this paper if using code and quote appropriately.

DATA:
----------------------------------------
The raw_complex_yeast.txt data was obtained from supplementary data s2 in [1]. The data contained in this dataset, originated from four existing protein complex sets (CM270 [2], CM425 [2] [3] [4], CYC408 and CTC428 both from CYC2008 [5], [6]). 
essential_proteins_yeast.txt and nonessential_proteins_yeast.txt was obtained from supplementary data s1 in [7] which originated from MIPS [8], SGD [9], DEG [10] and SGDP [11]. 
LBBC_centralities.txt resulted from using code provided in [7] applied to the MIPS PIN. This code can be found at https://github.com/qindynasty/LBCC.
